# Project Description: SQL Data Analysis for Business Insights

/*This project focuses on analyzing and deriving business 
insights from a dataset that includes various aspects of a music storeâ€™s sales, 
customer behavior, and playlist interactions. 
The goal was to use SQL to explore and extract meaningful patterns from transactional and metadata information,
helping inform business decisions.*/

## Chinook is an online digital media store.

/*
## Question #1:
Write a solution to find the employee_id of managers with at least 2 direct reports.


Expected column names: employee_id

*/

-- q1 solution:

  reports_to
HAVING COUNT (reports_to)>=2)
SELECT
  employee_id
FROM employee
WHERE 
  employee_id in (select reports from num_reports);




# Question #2: 
/* Calculate total revenue for MPEG-4 video files purchased in 2024.

create a comma separated list of the corresponding (distinct) playlist names.
